Hi
This will download the package again and uncompress it for installation. However, if that don't fix the issue, I recommend doing the following:

yum remove git
yum clean all
yum install git
 installed git using

sudo yum install git
I believe git is corrupted in some manner, when I try to clone a repository from github it asks for my bitbucket password and the clone isn't a clone. I would like to reinstall git, by first uninstalling git. However all the related answers are for ubuntu and windows.

With fedora how do I uninstall git?
